# About
Flow cytometry enables monitoring of large and diverse cell populations using fluorescent markers. Its applications span the study of biological properties in blood and tissues, as well as diagnostics in clinical settings. Recent methodological advancements emphasize automatic clustering as a preferred tool for data analysis. Numerous clustering algorithms have been developed for various use cases. However, the practical utility of these algorithms in biology and medicine remains challenging unless they offer user-friendly, interactive interfaces accessible to domain experts. 

Ash is a project that aims to gap the bridge between data collection and analysis. Ash provides the user with tools for data analysis
without the need for a programming background.

Ash was created as a part of a diploma thesis. See the links below for more information.
